Here's a summary of why each location is predicted to be a crime hotspot, based on the provided features:

*   **Broxburn, Uphall and Winchburgh (West Lothian):** This area is likely to experience continued crime problems due to high levels of crime in recent history (as seen from positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1* and *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag6*). Furthermore, this area may not be improving as significantly as would be hoped based on *normalized_crime_delta_lag1* and *normalized_crime_delta_lag6*

*   **Inverurie and District (Aberdeenshire):** This area is predicted to be a hotspot because of recently high crime levels (positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1*) and a sharp recent increase in crime relative to its average (positive *normalized_crime_delta_lag1* and *normalized_crime_delta_lag2*).

*   **Dingwall and Seaforth (Highland):** High recent crime levels (positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1* and *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag6*) coupled with a recent increase in crime (positive *normalized_crime_delta_lag1*) which follows a recent decrease in crime relative to its average (*normalized_crime_delta_lag2*).

*   **Mid and Upper Nithsdale (Dumfries and Galloway):** This area is predicted to be a hotspot due to high recent crime levels (positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1*) combined with a sharp recent increase in crime relative to its average (positive *normalized_crime_delta_lag1*), even despite drops in crime in the more distant past.

*   **East Berwickshire (Scottish Borders):** This area is predicted to be a crime hotspot due to a very high recent increase in crime relative to its average (positive *normalized_crime_delta_lag1*) along with generally high recent crime levels (positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1*).

*   **Armadale and Blackridge (West Lothian):** High recent crime levels (positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1*) and a recent increase in crime relative to its average (positive *normalized_crime_delta_lag1*) are the primary drivers for this hotspot prediction.

*   **Kincorth/Nigg/Cove (Aberdeen City):** This area is experiencing very high levels of recent crime (positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1*) and a large recent increase in crime relative to its average (positive *normalized_crime_delta_lag1*), however it did experience a recent decrease in crime relative to its average (negative *normalized_crime_delta_lag2*).

*   **Kingswells/Sheddocksley/Summerhill (Aberdeen City):** Predicted to be a hotspot because of high recent crime levels (positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1*) and a sharp recent increase in crime relative to its average (positive *normalized_crime_delta_lag1*).

*   **Mid Argyll (Argyll and Bute):** This area is likely a hotspot due to high recent crime levels (positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1*) and a recent increase in crime relative to its average (positive *normalized_crime_delta_lag1* and *normalized_crime_delta_lag2*).

*   **Preston/Seton/Gosford (East Lothian):** Prediction is primarily driven by high recent crime levels (positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1*) and a recent increase in crime relative to its average (positive *normalized_crime_delta_lag1* and *normalized_crime_delta_lag2*).

*   **Kelso and District (Scottish Borders):** This area is predicted to be a crime hotspot due to a very high recent increase in crime relative to its average (positive *normalized_crime_delta_lag1*) along with high recent crime levels (positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1*).

*   **Nairn and Cawdor (Highland):** This area is experiencing high levels of recent crime (positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1*) and a large recent increase in crime relative to its average (positive *normalized_crime_delta_lag1*).

*   **Bearsden South (East Dunbartonshire):** This area is likely a hotspot due to high levels of recent crime (positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1*) and a large recent increase in crime relative to its average (positive *normalized_crime_delta_lag1*).

*   **Culloden and Ardersier (Highland):** High recent crime levels (positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1*) combined with a recent increase in crime relative to its average (positive *normalized_crime_delta_lag1* and *normalized_crime_delta_lag2*) are likely drivers for the prediction.

*   **Banff and District (Aberdeenshire):** Predicted hotspot due to a very high recent increase in crime relative to its average (positive *normalized_crime_delta_lag1*) along with generally high recent crime levels (positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1*).

*   **Trossachs and Teith (Stirling):** This area is likely a hotspot due to high recent crime levels (positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1*) combined with a sharp recent increase in crime relative to its average (positive *normalized_crime_delta_lag1*).

*   **Morningside (City of Edinburgh):** High recent crime levels (positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1*) and a recent increase in crime relative to its average (positive *normalized_crime_delta_lag1* and *normalized_crime_delta_lag2*) are the primary drivers for this hotspot prediction.

*   **Huntly, Strathbogie and Howe of Alford (Aberdeenshire):** This area is predicted to be a crime hotspot due to extremely high levels of recent crime (positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1*) and a extremely high recent increase in crime relative to its average (positive *normalized_crime_delta_lag1*). There are indications of improvement (as *normalized_crime_delta_lag2* is negative), so crime may be improving soon.

*   **Strathmartine (Dundee City):** Though relatively low recent crime levels (positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1*), this area is likely to become a hotspot due to high crime levels in the past (positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag6* and *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag2*), even despite a possible recent decrease in crime relative to its average (negative *normalized_crime_delta_lag1*).

*   **Aboyne, Upper Deeside and Donside (Aberdeenshire):** Predicted to be a hotspot because of high recent crime levels (positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1*) and a sharp recent increase in crime relative to its average (positive *normalized_crime_delta_lag1* and *normalized_crime_delta_lag2*).

*   **Kyle (South Ayrshire):** This area is predicted to be a crime hotspot due to a very high recent increase in crime relative to its average (positive *normalized_crime_delta_lag1*) along with generally high recent crime levels (positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1*).

*   **Westhill and District (Aberdeenshire):** This area is likely a hotspot due to generally high levels of recent crime (positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1*) and a recent increase in crime relative to its average (positive *normalized_crime_delta_lag1*).

*   **Isle of Bute (Argyll and Bute):** Predicted hotspot because of high recent crime levels (positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1*) and a sharp recent increase in crime relative to its average (positive *normalized_crime_delta_lag1* and *normalized_crime_delta_lag2*).

*   **East Sutherland and Edderton (Highland):** This area is predicted to be a crime hotspot due to generally high levels of recent crime (positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1*) and a large recent increase in crime relative to its average (positive *normalized_crime_delta_lag1*).

*   **Kirkwall West and Orphir (Orkney Islands):** Prediction is primarily driven by high recent crime levels (positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1*) and a recent increase in crime relative to its average (positive *normalized_crime_delta_lag1* and *normalized_crime_delta_lag2*).

*   **Caol and Mallaig (Highland):** This area is predicted to be a crime hotspot due to extremely high levels of recent crime (positive *TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1*) and a extremely high recent increase in crime relative to its average (positive *normalized_crime_delta_lag1*). However it did experience a decrease in crime relative to its average (negative *normalized_crime_delta_lag2*).

**Key Takeaways:**

*   ***TOTAL DETECTED CRIME_lag1***: This is the most dominant feature, meaning that the model heavily relies on recent crime levels to predict future hotspots. High recent crime is a strong indicator of continued problems.
*   ***normalized_crime_delta_lag1***: This feature highlights recent increases in crime relative to the average. A strong positive value suggests a rapidly worsening situation.
*   ***normalized_crime_delta_lag2***: Positive values for this feature suggest that the area may be in an upward trend of crime.

It's important to remember that these are predictions based on historical data and trends. Intervention and preventative measures could significantly alter the actual crime patterns in these areas.
